    "# What does a Research Assistant do in a Medical Research Laboratory?\n",
    "\n",
    "When I worked as a research assistant I was asked to keep a todo list to record what I planned to do and what I managed to get done. I managed to hold onto these and have collated them together. I present some data from them here. Although, in the interests of privacy, I don't intend to publish the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an analysis of my todo lists from the time I spent as a Research Assistant in a Life Sciences laboratory during 2018 and 2019. So far it includes the ipython notebooks for parsing the file from a word document (thanks to the docx python library) into a usable csv file, and some basic analysis of the data. The csv files and todo list word document are purposefully omitted to protect privacy. I will upload dummy versions of these at some point to give a better idea of the data used for this.\n",
