This is an analysis of my todo lists from the time I spent as a Research Assistant in a Life Sciences laboratory during 2018 and 2019. So far it includes the ipython notebooks for parsing the file from a word document (thanks to the docx pyhon library author!) into a usable csv file, and some basic analysis of the data. The csv files and todo list word document are purposefully omitted to protect privacy. I will upload dummy versions of these at some point to give a better idea of the data used for this.
